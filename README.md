# Repackaged-Antennas
Overhaul of the Antennas mod
This is a repackaged version of DTPhatom's Antennas mod.  It overhauls all config files for the antennas but the orginal models created by DTPhantom remain.  New versions of the Module Manager configurations for Antenna Range by toadicus are included offering versions for both stock and OPM configurations.  

Since RemoteTech and Telemachus are now both updated for version 1.1.2 I have included the original patches but I do not support them.  Please take questions regarding either file to the original thread listed below or to their respective mod's page.

For more information on the original mod please see: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113109-105antennas-additional-antennas-for-both-remote-tech-and-telemachusv1316-feb-16/&page=1
