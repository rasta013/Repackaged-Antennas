# Repackaged-Antennas
Overhaul of the Antennas mod
This is a repackaged version of DTPhatom's Antennas mod.  It overhauls all config files for the antennas but the orginal models created by DTPhantom remain.  New versions of the Module Manager configurations for Antenna Range by toadicus are included offering versions for both stock and OPM configurations.

For more information on the original mod please see: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/113109-105antennas-additional-antennas-for-both-remote-tech-and-telemachusv1316-feb-16/&page=1
